# Catbox Scanner

cringe code i cooked in few hrs it just works and i dont wanna invest much time in it (atlest rn)

Simple to use just build it using `go build` command and change config to ur liking and run the executable. Also executable and config file should be in same directory rn i have not added cli flags cuz i am lazy ik its just a 10 sec task but who cares.

I am now using postgresql so setup a server first
